# ElasticRAG
Integrating Elasticsearch, FAISS, and LLAMA3 to create a system for efficient document retrieval, embedding, similarity search, and question answering.

The project was done completely locally on my pc.

PC specs:
I7 10gen
16gb ram
nvidia rtx 3060 6gb
100 gb SSD space 
ubuntu latest LTS

I ran the llama3 8b model, I recommend having more vram for faster response, 
I optimized the code to run even on systems without graphics card yet the response time is higher.
